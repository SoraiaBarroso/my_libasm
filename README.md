# Welcome to My Libasm
***

## Task
An assembly language is a low-level programming language designed for a specific type of processor. It may be produced by compiling source code from a high-level programming language (such as C/C++) but can also be written from scratch. <br>
There are multiple languages assembly, in this project we are using 'nasm 64'

## Description

In this project we implement the following standard C library functions in 'nasm 64':

```
- strlen      -> my_strlen
- strchr      -> my_strchr
- memset      -> my_memset
- memcpy      -> my_memcpy
- strcmp      -> my_strcmp
- memmove     -> my_memmove

- strncmp     -> my_strncmp
- strcasecmp  -> my_strcasecmp
- index       -> my_index

- read        -> my_read
- write       -> my_write
```

## Installation
run make and execute:

```
make
./my_libasm

```

## Usage
```
make
./my_libasm
```
